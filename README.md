# E-commerce Chatbot using Machine Learning and NLP
This repository hosts the code for an advanced chatbot developed during our internship, specifically designed for integration with e-commerce platforms. The chatbot utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to customer queries, providing accurate and real-time information about products.

# Key Features:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables the chatbot to understand customer queries phrased in natural language, ensuring intuitive and human-like interactions.
Machine Learning (ML): The chatbot continuously learns and improves over time, refining its search accuracy based on user interactions and purchase data.
Integration with E-commerce Platform: Seamlessly connects with the e-commerce platform's product database to provide real-time inventory information and accurate search results.
APIs: Utilizes RESTful APIs to integrate the chatbot with the e-commerce platform's search functionality, ensuring smooth and effective communication between systems.
Real-time Processing: Ensures that the chatbot can process queries and provide results instantly, delivering a smooth and responsive user experience.

# Technologies Used:
Python
NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK, SpaCy)
Machine Learning Frameworks (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Flask (for backend API integration)
RESTful APIs
Git & GitHub (for version control)
